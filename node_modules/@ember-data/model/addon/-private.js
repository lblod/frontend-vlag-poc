    In case someone defined a relationship to a mixin, for example:
    ```
      import Model, { belongsTo, hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
      import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';

      class CommentModel extends Model {
        @belongsTo('commentable', { polymorphic: true }) owner;
      }

      let Commentable = Mixin.create({
        @hasMany('comment') comments;
      });
    ```
    we want to look up a Commentable class which has all the necessary
    relationship meta data. Thus, we look up the mixin and create a mock
    Model, so we can access the relationship CPs of the mixin (`comments`)
    in this case
