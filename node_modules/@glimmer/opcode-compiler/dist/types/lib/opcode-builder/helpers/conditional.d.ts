/**
 * A convenience for pushing some arguments on the stack and
 * running some code if the code needs to be re-executed during
 * updating execution if some of the arguments have changed.
 *
 * # Initial Execution
 *
 * The `args` function should push zero or more arguments onto
 * the stack and return the number of arguments pushed.
 *
 * The `body` function provides the instructions to execute both
 * during initial execution and during updating execution.
 *
 * Internally, this function starts by pushing a new frame, so
 * that the body can return and sets the return point ($ra) to
 * the ENDINITIAL label.
 *
 * It then executes the `args` function, which adds instructions
 * responsible for pushing the arguments for the block to the
 * stack. These arguments will be restored to the stack before
 * updating execution.
 *
 * Next, it adds the Enter opcode, which marks the current position
 * in the DOM, and remembers the current $pc (the next instruction)
 * as the first instruction to execute during updating execution.
 *
 * Next, it runs `body`, which adds the opcodes that should
 * execute both during initial execution and during updating execution.
 * If the `body` wishes to finish early, it should Jump to the
 * `FINALLY` label.
 *
 * Next, it adds the FINALLY label, followed by:
 *
 * - the Exit opcode, which finalizes the marked DOM started by the
 *   Enter opcode.
 * - the Return opcode, which returns to the current return point
 *   ($ra).
 *
 * Finally, it adds the ENDINITIAL label followed by the PopFrame
 * instruction, which restores $fp, $sp and $ra.
 *
 * # Updating Execution
 *
 * Updating execution for this `replayable` occurs if the `body` added an
 * assertion, via one of the `JumpIf`, `JumpUnless` or `AssertSame` opcodes.
 *
 * If, during updating executon, the assertion fails, the initial VM is
 * restored, and the stored arguments are pushed onto the stack. The DOM
 * between the starting and ending markers is cleared, and the VM's cursor
 * is set to the area just cleared.
 *
 * The return point ($ra) is set to -1, the exit instruction.
 *
 * Finally, the $pc is set to to the instruction saved off by the
 * Enter opcode during initial execution, and execution proceeds as
 * usual.
 *
 * The only difference is that when a `Return` instruction is
 * encountered, the program jumps to -1 rather than the END label,
 * and the PopFrame opcode is not needed.

/**
 * A specialized version of the `replayable` convenience that allows the
 * caller to provide different code based upon whether the item at
 * the top of the stack is true or false.
 *
 * As in `replayable`, the `ifTrue` and `ifFalse` code can invoke `return`.
 *
 * During the initial execution, a `return` will continue execution
 * in the cleanup code, which finalizes the current DOM block and pops
 * the current frame.
 *
 * During the updating execution, a `return` will exit the updating
 * routine, as it can reuse the DOM block and is always only a single
 * frame deep.
